# AI Model Testing for Sentiment Analysis

## Project Description

This project focuses on testing an AI model developed for sentiment analysis. The aim is to ensure the model's accuracy and performance across different datasets and scenarios. The project includes data validation, model performance evaluation, and stress testing under various conditions.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: For scripting and automation.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and testing AI models.
- **PyTest**: For creating and running test cases.

## Test Cases

1. **Model Accuracy**
   - **Description**: Validate the accuracy of the AI model with a test dataset.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Load the test dataset.
     2. Run the model on the test dataset.
     3. Compare the model's predictions with the actual results.
   - **Expected Result**: The model achieves the desired accuracy.

2. **Performance Under Load**
   - **Description**: Test the model's performance under high load.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Simulate a high number of requests to the model.
     2. Monitor the model's response time and accuracy.
   - **Expected Result**: The model maintains performance and accuracy.

3. **Edge Case Testing**
   - **Description**: Validate the model's performance on edge cases and unusual inputs.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Create a dataset with edge cases and unusual inputs.
     2. Run the model on this dataset.
     3. Evaluate the model's predictions.
   - **Expected Result**: The model handles edge cases appropriately.
